# explanation (see also tigervnc manual):
#
# -DisconnectClients -NeverShared:
#     Only allow one connected client at a time.
#
# -nocursor:
#     Since the Screen Sharing app doesn't remove the macOS cursor,
#     disables the cursor within the container.
#
# -geometry ...:
#     Reads the current value from the vnc_resolution file and adjusts
#     the resolution accordingly.
#
# -SecurityTypes VncAuth -PasswordFile /home/user/.vnc/passwd:
#     The connection is unencrypted and the encoded password file
#     is generated from the file called "vncpasswd". You can change it,
#     but the password needs to be 6-8 characters long. This is done so
#     that the Screen Sharing app can be started with the password embedded
#     in the URI. This is by itself insecure, but the Docker container
#     won't allow any inbound traffic other than from the macOS host, so
#     it should be ok. Note that the VNC password does not have to be
#     the same as the user password.
#
# -localhost no:
#     Allows connections from clients other than localhost. This allows
#     macOS to connect to it. Now the exposed VNC server is very insecure
#     but you can only connect to it from the macOS host so even with a
#     disabled firewall, no outside computer could connect to it (see
#     the "docker run" command with the -p option).
#
# -verbose -fg:
#     Display the status of the VNC server and make it such that it stays
#     in the foreground. This makes the Docker container shut down as soon
#     as the X session is quit (using the Logout button in the lower right
#     corner).
#
# -RawKeyboard -RemapKeys "0xffe9->0xff7e,0xffe7->0xff7e":
#     This makes special characters that are typed using the opt-key
#     typeable by reassigning the "Alt_L" and "Meta_L" keys to the
#     "Mode_switch" key.
#
# -- LXDE:
#    Starts an LXDE session.
